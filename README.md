Problems:
I first started coding and fixing bugs by using localhost. Everything was going smoothly until I deployed the backend to heroku and I kept getting error messages. I had errors for different parts of my app at different times. Sometimes it would work until a certain point but then an error would show somewhere else. Somehow I was able to add 1 document to my database but I could not reproduce the result. Trying to solve this problem just killed my time and I was not able to get CRUD working for my app.

Outlook:
I enjoyed making my first full-stack app, even though it is not really functioning. I think I need more practice with heroku to get it to work in sync with my app. Hopefully on my free time I can revisit this project and work out all the kinks so it can become the app I envisioned.
